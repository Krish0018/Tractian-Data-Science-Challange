# Tractian-Data-Science-Challange

This challenge was related to vibration Analysis. I had to do some analysis and create the functions as per the questions mentioned. 

It was a completely new domain for me in regards of data science. I tried some research about time domain and frequencey domain. And Then tried to solve the questions. 

Althogh I have found it really interesting domain as a mechanical engineer and would love to work in this domain more.
